                <p className="mb-4">
                  Eight years ago in 2018, I was an ordinary young woman living simply, trying to find my place in the world. After finishing school, I was lucky enough to land a job at NEMA as an assistant. I loved it. I admired the officers — sharp, confident, committed. I dreamed of one day becoming a permanent and pensionable environmental officer. Maybe rise through the ranks — county director, regional head, and if I worked super hard, maybe even reach the Deputy Director General. That was the vision... until one day changed everything.
                </p>
                
                <div className="my-6 p-4 border-l-4 border-brand-green bg-white dark:bg-gray-800">
                  <p className="italic text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                    "I remember it like it was yesterday. I was in the office, buried in work, when a man and a woman walked in. They asked to see the County Director of Environment, but she was in a meeting with the Environmental Officers. Some non-compliant facilities had been raided earlier on and prosecution preparations was underway."
                  </p>
                </div>
                
                <p className="mb-4">
                  I asked them to wait. They looked exhausted — the woman was sweating, visibly anxious. I assumed it was just the stairs. But then, she broke down. She cried. Right there in front of me.
                </p>
                
                <p className="mb-4">
                  I was confused. I asked if she needed water, help, anything. She asked for the washroom. I escorted her out and she decided what she needed was to catch a breath not the wash room... I didn't know how to console her, I didn't know what to tell her... So we stood outside, in silence. I had no words. She just breathed. I just stood there as she calmed herself down.
                </p>
                
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Eventually, she gathered herself and we went back to the office. After a short while the meeting was done and they could now talk to the director. As the officers came from the Director's office one of them said: "Haiya, mumefika? Mnataka kumwona Mkubwa?" I asked quietly what was going on. And then I heard her story.

                  <p>
                    She had leased a small petrol station business from a former operator three years ago. She invested and built it up for three years but either without knowing she needed NEMA approvals or she had ignored them. So the facility had been red marked as non-compliant. Now she was supposed to pay the License fee for the past years and penalties accumulated...the business had been shut down and a prosecution case to answer...
                  </p>
                </div>

                  I got my nose in this woman's case and I understood that after many months of court case, she lost, paid the penalties. She was still paying off the bank loan and with all the extra penalties, she lost her business. Time. Sweat. Money. Apparently she didn't know she needed NEMA approval and for three years, she operated the petrol station without them.
                </p>
                
                <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">
                  What happened to all the sweat, blood, tears, time she had invested? What about her children and husband? What about her family? What about the young men & women she had employed?
